Trac Graphviz Plugin v0.6 Release Notes
=======================================
Mar 23, 2006

Graphviz plugin v0.6.1 for Trac is now available. The Graphviz wiki
processor is a plugin for Trac that allows the the dynamic generation
of diagrams by the various graphviz programs. The text of a wiki page
can contain the source text for graphviz and the web browser will show
the resulting image.


Changes for release v0.6.1
--------------------------

* Applied patch from eblot to correct the regular expression for
  embedded URLs. Resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/161.

* Renamed module variable __version__ to __revision__ to better
  reflect the intent.

* Moved the release version number from setup.py to
  graphviz/graphviz.py. The version number is now logged when the
  graphviz module is initialized.

* Commented out the many self.log.debug messages. As pointed out in,
  http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/238, the core seems to be mostly stable
  and having lots and lots of debugging messages may no longer be
  needed.

* Added defaults for the cache management control values:

  * cache_max_size = 10,000,000
  * cache_min_size = 5,000,000
  * cache_max_count = 2,000
  * cache_min_count = 1,500

  The resolves issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/160.


Changes for release v0.6
------------------------

 * In render_macro, corrected the self.log.debug statements that were
   printing out the req.args and req.base_url. They are not always
   available. Removed the reference to req.base_url since it was not
   being used and may not always be an attribute to req.  Resolves
   issue http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/193.

 * Added import for the inspect module. Resolves issue
   http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/236.


Changes for release v0.5.1
--------------------------

 * Corrected typo in graphviz.py where the wrong internal variable was
   being used to display an error message.


Changes for release v0.5
------------------------

 * Added a note in the Readme.txt wrt using load_examples.py to import
   the Graphviz examples into a wiki. Fixed load_examples.py so that
   it correctly looks for Graphviz examples in directories other than
   the working directory.

 * Fixed a bug whereby image maps were a bit off when using the png
   antialiasing option.

 * URL= strings in diagrams can now have Trac wiki links like
   ticket:1, report:7, changeset:47, wiki:CamelCasePage,
   milestone:milestone1 and source:Readme.txt.

 * Added additional examples for links in SVG images and using Trac
   wiki links.

 * Fixed the bug #102 (http://trac-hacks.swapoff.org/ticket/102)
   whereby popen2.Popen3 is not available on Windows.


Changes for release v0.4
------------------------

 * Map support for bitmap images, allowing to use URL="" attributes in
   graphs. Maps are only generated if the URL= string is found in the
   Graphviz diagram.

 * Antialiasing on PNG images, using rsvg, from
   <http://librsvg.sf.net>.

 * Better display of SVG images and IE support.

 * Display errors graphviz may produce.

 * Support for global graph options.

 * Updated documentation.

 * Example graphs have been created to outline the basic capabilities
   of the plugin.

 * The tmp_dir is no longer needed. Instead of creating temp files to
   be processed by graphviz, the plugin now communicates with the
   graphviz programs through pipes.

 * Expanded info and debugging messages to allow for better debugging
   of the running environment.

 * Error messages that occur when running the grapviz programs will
   now be displayed in the browser. This should help in resolving
   syntax problems with graphviz code.

 * Graphviz program paths are now enclosed in quotes. This should
   resolve the problem when there are spaces in the path as is typical
   on Windows.


Changes for release v0.3
------------------------

 * A simple cache manager has been added to keep the cache disk space
   and directory entry count under control. A series of parameters in
   the [graphviz] section of the trac.ini configuration file are used
   to control the cache manager.

 * The tmp files used in processing the graphviz language are now
   deleted after the new image is created.

 * A series of debugging statements are now in the code. See the Trac
   logging documentation section for details on how logging works.

The plugin has been tested on a Linux x86 system running python 2.4
and the latest version of trac from subversion. Testing on other
platforms would be appreciated.
